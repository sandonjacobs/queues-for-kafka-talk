== Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Apache Kafka's Share Consumers feature (KIP-932) through a practical example. It includes a producer that generates events and a consumer that processes them using the share consumer protocol.

== Project Structure

The project is organized into three modules:

* `common`: Shared utilities and configuration
* `kafka-producer`: Event producer application
* `kafka-queues-consumer`: Consumer application using share consumers

== Building and Testing

The project uses Maven for building and testing. A Makefile is provided to simplify common operations.

=== Building the Project

To build the entire project:

[source,bash]
----
make build
----

This will clean, compile, and package all modules.

=== Running Tests

To run all tests across all modules:

[source,bash]
----
make test
----

To run tests for specific modules:

[source,bash]
----
# Run tests for common module
make test-common

# Run tests for producer module
make test-kafka-producer

# Run tests for consumer module
make test-queue-consumer
----

== Docker Environment

The project includes a Docker Compose setup for running Kafka and related services.

=== Starting the Environment

To start the Kafka environment:

[source,bash]
----
make docker-start
----

This will start all required services in detached mode.

=== Viewing Logs

To view the logs from all services:

[source,bash]
----
make docker-logs
----

=== Stopping and Cleaning Up

To stop the environment:

[source,bash]
----
make docker-stop
----

To remove all containers and networks:

[source,bash]
----
make docker-remove
----

To stop and remove everything in one command:

[source,bash]
----
make docker-clean
----

== Running the Applications

=== Producer Application

To view help for the producer application:

[source,bash]
----
make help-kafka-producer
----

To run the producer with custom arguments:

[source,bash]
----
make run-kafka-producer ARGS="--properties /path/to/properties --duration 120 --interval 1000"
----

Available arguments:
* `--properties`: Path to Kafka client properties file (required)
* `--duration`: Duration in seconds for the producer to run (default: 60)
* `--interval`: Interval in milliseconds between producing events (default: 500)

=== Consumer Application

To view help for the consumer application:

[source,bash]
----
make help-queue-consumer
----

To run the consumer with custom arguments:

[source,bash]
----
make run-queue-consumer ARGS="--properties /path/to/properties --group-id my-group --consumers 5"
----

Available arguments:
* `--properties`: Path to Kafka client properties file (required)
* `--group-id`: Consumer group ID (required)
* `--consumers`: Number of consumer instances to run (default: 1)

== Getting Help
